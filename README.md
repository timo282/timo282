üëã Hi there! 

I'm Timo, a data science enthusiast currently doing my Masters in Statistics and Data Science at LMU Munich and working as a Data Scientist at Liebherr-Aerospace. With a background in Business Informatics ‚Äì Data Science and hands-on experience in various IT and Data Science projects, I'm passionate about leveraging mathematical methods and algorithms, exploring the power of Machine Learning and AI, in order to uncover new insights and hidden patterns in data, solve complex problems and derive business value from data in various domains.

### üíª Projects
My repository encompasses a broad range of different projects, including university projects as well as private projects and competitions: From classical desktop applications in Java ([Farming Simulator](https://github.com/timo282/FarmingHole)), and Web-Interfaces with HTML/CSS/JavaScript ([Matrix Calculator](https://github.com/finitearth/Gaussian-Elimination-GUI)), to Machine Learning Projects in Python ([Tanzanian Pump Prediction](https://github.com/timo282/Tanzania_Pumps_Prediction) & [Test Function Simulation](https://github.com/mo374z/OptimizationTestfunctionGeneration)), Natural Language Processing (["The Office" Analysis with Speaker Classification and Scene Generation Models](https://github.com/timo282/NLP-The-Office) & [Home Assistant "Hey Jarvis"]()), Prompt Tuning ([Python-Library "Promptolution"](https://github.com/finitearth/promptolution)), and Computer Vision ([Plot Legend Detection](https://github.com/REDA-solutions/PlotLegendDetectionCV)), as well as work on optimization ([PSO for Optimization of GPs](https://github.com/PascalKnoll/Investigation-of-Particle-Swarm-Optimization)), and interpretability ([Feature Effects Empirical Analysis](https://github.com/timo282/feature-effect-empirical-analysis)).
